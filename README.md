# CUET-Trinity-NLP-Hackathon


### Deep Learning Model:

As the deep learning model file is too big. 
We've uploaded the model file on a drive. You can access the file via this link

[Deep Learning Model file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bgFPy7qD6gbi1QymzEM8-53viEaBA8a7)

We've exported the tokenizer file named `tokenizer.pkl`

To run, there is a cell named "Run from this cell". 

We just want to say, We just messed up everything for this we didn't get the time to add proper documentation.
